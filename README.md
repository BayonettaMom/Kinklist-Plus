# Kinklist-Plus

A simple HTML template that allows the user to provide explanations for their own kinklist made through [Goctionni's Kinklist creator](https://github.com/Goctionni/KinkList).

### What does it do?
Put simply, Kinklist-Plus is a single HTML document that causes modals to appear when the name of a kink is clicked with the purpose of allowing the user to explain their choice.
If you'd like an example of this in action, my own list may be found [here](http://bayonetta.moms.exposed/kinklist).

### To-do
 - redo image map/replace with equivalent feature
 - modify modals to display better on mobile devices
 - make code easier to navigate
 
### License
Kinklist-Plus is licensed under WTFPL, and while I'd love for you to keep the credits line, you are allowed to remove it if you'd like (as WTFPL states).
